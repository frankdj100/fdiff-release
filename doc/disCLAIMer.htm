<center><h3>DisCLAIMer</h3></center>

The text of claims (and descriptions) are retrieved from two systems, <b>EPOQUE</b> and <b>Fulltext Master</b> (<b>FTM</b>); <b>FTM</b> is the system which also supplies the text versions of claims to <b>Trimaran</b> and <b>ANSERA</b>.

<p>

If you notice that one or more sets of claims are missing, this may be for a variety of reasons:

<ol>

<li>The claims were only <u>recently filed</u> (eg. after a telephone conversation/exchange of emails), and have not yet been OCRed. Due to the terms of the <u>Service Level Agreement</u> with <u>Jouve</u>, who are responsible for OCRing new submissions, it may take up to 10 days for new submissions to be available in the EPO systems in text format;

<p>

<li>Multiple requests were filed on the same day (eg. a <b>Main</b> request and one or more <b>Auxiliary</b> requests); in such a case, it is possible that only <u>some</u> of the requests may have been OCRed;

<p>
 
<li>The file is <u>old</u>, meaning that some submissions of interest were not OCRed for some reason;

<p>

<li>The file is a <u>Euro PCT</u> file - these are notorious for being badly processed, with certain claim sets being completely excluded from being OCRed.

</ol>

<p>

Essentially, if a claim set of interest is not available in <b>Trimaran</b> or <b>ANSERA</b>, then it has not (yet) been OCred, meaning that the text version of the claims is not available in <b>FTM</b>; this makes it impossible for such a set of claims to be retrieved automatically by a preparation. However, the preparations <b>..FDIFF</b>, <b>..WORDSTAT</b> and <b>..TRI QUOTE</b> do have mechanisms to support the inclusion of <u>manually OCRed</u> claim sets.

<p>

If you are not satisfied with this situation, please send a complaint to <b>SERVICE LINE</b> and/or <b>DOCHELP</b>, providing the dossier number and explaining why it is essential that the text of a particular submission be available.
